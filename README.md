# Gen-Meme
I am working on this project for my software development, capstone 691. As someone new to the software development program, creating a web application such as a meme generator will be a good start. This project must have a database for users, and it must be fully user interactive. The name of this web application will be Gen Meme(Generate Memes).Gen memes is a web application that users can use to generate & download random memes.I Will be creating a database containing three tables, which will be Users*, Memes*, and Account. On the user UI, I have Mainly three buttons that users will be interacting with. There will be buttons on the right side of the screen that users can click to generate random memes or jokes, and also, there will be a download button that they could use to download their favorite memes to their account.

This project is my first major software project, and any suggestions are welcome!

Thank you.
